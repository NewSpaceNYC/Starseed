### Future plans:
 - livecoding_stream :) (probably anyways to make it open and as a Google Hangouts addon)
 - machine learning, all the things
 - use slack as plugin for chat

### ideas:
 - for our version of live coding we can have a mobile app... can have bluetooth... 
 - have a virtual office in a minecraft world and spawn up VMs with computer blocks and collaborate
 - in an embedded cloud9 - and then visualize the code with minecraft blocks - errors can be volcanoes -
