                <span>Q:</span><p> What's a pico/micro fund?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> A pico/micro fund supplies small amounts of cash to ideas, startups, school programs/projects/clubs. Usually under 1k USD.</p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> Why $100?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> This is what the fund can afford at this time. Every little bit helps and <i>it feels great to give!</i></p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> What was your inspiration for a pico fund?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> See https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants</p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> Who are you and what do you do?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> Starseed was created by an anonymous innovator and a business partner. You'll learn more about them when your proposal gets accepted.</p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> You want equity in my company for $100 are you joking?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> With the rise of micro funding, crowdfunding and such, it's not too much to ask for a percentage of equity.  Use as many decimal places as you'd like.  This will help us keep an interest in you.</p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> What if I don't have a company yet?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> We'd like you to have one eventually and would like to share in building it with you.</p></br>
                <br>  
                <span>Q:</span><p> What else do I get besides $100?</p></br>
                <span>A:</span><p> Our team has massive domain knowledge when it comes to startups, funding and innovation.  We will help in any way we can to make the business a success.</p></br>
                <br>
