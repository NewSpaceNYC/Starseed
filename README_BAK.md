[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/NewSpaceNYC/Starseed.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/NewSpaceNYC/Starseed) ![Codeship](https://codeship.com/projects/353dec70-72ac-0133-ff64-1a41efae3cbb/status?branch=master)

A project that aims to be a whitelabeled [assmebly.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150224002521/https://assembly.com/) (for all types of projects that can effectively leverage bounties)
no lock in... etc... check this document for high level outline:

### Future plans:
 - livecoding_stream :) (probably anyways to make it open and as a Google Hangouts addon)
 - machine learning, all the things

### ideas:
 - for our version of live coding we can have a mobile app... can have bluetooth... 
 - have a virtual office in a minecraft world and spawn up VMs with computer blocks and collaborate
 - in an embedded cloud9 - and then visualize the code with minecraft blocks - errors can be volcanoes -

 Roadmap:

 From Google Doc Brainstorm: http://goo.gl/WTH2tm

### leaderboard
 - companies that can opt-in to the monthly milestone prize via equity or cash buy-in.
 - So for example, companies that haven’t reached a milestone of 10k in sales can opt-in for the 10k milestone leaderboard prize for that month and every month until they make that milestone. 


### equity deals
 - equity can be sold, traded
  - for example, let’s say a company wants to sell some of it’s shares, it does so on the platform either by selling unvested shares or making a board-member decision to dilute shares and sell them. 
   this way you could also offer a kickstarter and/or Gust type fundraising campaign where people can contribute to the project simply with their money contribution(s).
 - equity for ideamen
  - Submit ideas to Starseed and let the community manage it's development
 - No equity down
  - Use the platform for free, no commitments, insert cash or equity per bounty as needed. We act as the trusty escrow to your bounty hunters. 


### perfect for hackathons
 - I read a quote on the site saying it was like a on-going hackathon.
  - Hackathons are plagued with the problem of producing ground-breaking prototypes, often with poor or no follow up. 
 - With a siloed/hosted/white-labeled offering, hackathons could achieve decentralized greatness:
 - During Hackathons:
  - Mentors (and anyone really, both onsite & remote) could get rewarded for helping with features/bugs.
  - Extra points for the mentors if it’s the registered/onsite hacker/team-member doing the typing of the code (audited via Cloud9 for example to see who’s account is doing the typing)
  - Lean-a-thons... Earn-a-thons?!?!
   - Go to a learning hackathon and hack on real world coding problems with professional coders in a pair-programming style. 
   - Split the points 1 to 3 from students to mentors. 
   - This could be for any teaching class potentially (at certain levels of designated difficulty). No need to just be in a hackathon.


### whitelabel & so much open
 - White Label, 
  - cause @codedoc said so, and it is a good idea.  
  - Open-Source, like down to what kind of toilet paper we use...
  - this is a given.


### cash bounties too (use CoderBounty API)
 - set a cash value for bounties and just deposit the moolah into our escrow so people have the trusties.
 - mix and match, let users decided if they just want the cash or if they also want some equity, or just equity.
 - Whenever people have a choice, they feel more comfortable. It’s real science somewhere, look it up. 


### collaboration % bounty sharing
 - We want to live-code all the things so,
 - If two or more people are working on a bounty, they can, and at Starseed.com it shows in real-time who's working on which bounty
 - We then give contributors a UI to democratically self-divvy up the loot
